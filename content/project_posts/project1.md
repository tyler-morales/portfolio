brief:
    overview: "An Industry leader and innovator"
    background: "The International Space Station (ISS) is a multi-nation construction project that is the largest single structure humans ever put into space. Its main construction was completed between 1998 and 2011, although the station continually evolves to include new missions and experiments. It has been continuously occupied since Nov. 2, 2000."
technologies: [JS, HTML, CSS/ SASS]
thingsLearned: [API Intergration, Async-await function, HTML Data-themes]
PublishDate: 2019-02-07
codebase: "https://github.com/tyler-morales/textAdventure"
situation: "We need an interactive and real-time view of the ISS with a modern design"

scope:
    discovery: [Workshop, Research, Concepts, Competive Review, Project Planning]
    strategy: [Information Architecture, Interaction Design, Brand Personalization]
    design: [Art Direction, UI Design, Visual Moodboards, Wireframes/ Mockup]
    development: [Frontend Development, Accessibility Standards, Current Technologies/ processes]
process:
    step1: "Taking what I learned for our discussion, we were able to quickly realize how their three main pain points could be broken down and solved. Below I list three solutions/ features to their current problems and future goals for the ISS Tracker"
    step2: "Only when I have fully researched both into the visual aesthetics and competition, can I begin to set pencil to paper and start the design process."
    step3: "One of the most important pieces in creating a great product is how the user interacts with it. Because of this, every element, color and overall strategy is meticulously designed to help guide the user. In addition, the overall structure and layout is created in this step. This phase will pave the path for the rest of the project development and will be continually updated and referenced."
    step4: "It is finally time to begin how the product will visually look. This step can only be well done given the time and dedication to the previous steps. Without proper strategy, a visual interface lacks the effectiveness to compel users to continue using the product."
    step5: "One of the most important pieces in creating a great product is how the user interacts with it. Because of this, every element, color and overall strategy is meticulously designed to help guide the user. In addition, the overall structure and layout is created in this step. This phase will pave the path for the rest of the project development and will be continually updated and referenced."
goals: [Too much complexity, Increase number of users, Match design aesthetic of similar leading companies¹]
goalsFootnote: "¹SpaceX, Boeing, Lockheed Martin"
solutions: [Translate data into size-able/ readable chunks, Implement a SEO strategy, Use design best practices & systems]
moodboard: [Sleek, Modern, Professional, Strong]
competition: 
    one: "While ISS Tracker does have an array of data points and figures, it lack a clean and modern asthetic that is what is expected with the websites of today."
    two: "Visually, this tracker lacks in a modern style, however it does display a unique viewing of the globe that others have not included."
infoArc: "The aggregation of the many types and amount ofdata received from the ISS can be overwhelming tothose who are not in the field of astronomy.Information architecture gather all of the data–measurements, figures, facts etc., distills and/ orgroups them into similar groups. Then, it is possible tosee relationships and patterns."
interaction: "Given the groupings of information for the IA stage,the interaction design stage tries to make sense ofthose groups by searching for otherwise hiddenpatterns. When these patterns are uncovered, it is then easier to connect the dots between the originaldata/ information set. As a result, no longer is the userleft to understand the copious amounts of unfilteredinformation. The most important information isdisplayed beautifully & logically."

- title: API Intergration
  description: 
  - title: Using the latest ES6 features, thefetch API was a perfect use case forgrabbing data for a ISS data trackerAPI
- title: SASS
  description: 
  - title: I implemented a six system filestructure to organize my SASS files.This made it simple to reference andcreate module CSS
- title: Modular JS
  description: 
  - title: JS played a major role in thisproject. I made three files:functions.js, app.js & api.js. Thesemade it easy to debug and add anyfurther functionality 
- title: Accessibility 
  description: 
  - title: The entirety of the web app can beinterfaced through tabbing. Also, allcolors are AAA compliant andsemantic html makes it simple forscreen readers to process.
